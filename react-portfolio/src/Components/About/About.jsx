                I'm currently a student at Purdue Univeristy studying computer science. I am passionate about learning new technologies and skills to create innovative projects. 
                Besides programming, I love to study history in my free time and am also a big sports enthusiast, with my favorites being basketball and football.
                Feel free to reach out!
